# Task Manager

**Description**: -

The Task-Manager is an all-inclusive platform made to make it easier for managers and employees to communicate, assign tasks, and track progress. By emphasizing user roles, usability, and effective task management, this system guarantees that teams can work together productively and remain on top of their duties.

**Features:** -

**Registration and User Management**:

- **Manager Users**: Managers have the ability to create, update, delete, and assign tasks to workers.
- **Worker Users**: Workers can view the tasks assigned to them, update their task status (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed).

**Login and Role-Based Access Control**:

- Users must log in using secure credentials.
- Role-based access control is enforced by the system, guaranteeing that only authorized users can access particular routes or features. While workers can only view and change the tasks they have been assigned, managers have complete control over task and user management.

**Task Management**:

- Managers can create tasks with essential details such as title, description, priority, due date, and task status.
- Tasks can be updated by users to reflect changes in priority or due date.
- Workers can filter and view tasks based on **priority** and **due date**, helping them to prioritize their work effectively.

**Task-Based Chat**:

- Integrated **task-based chat** allows both managers and workers to communicate directly about specific tasks. This feature enhances collaboration, resolves misunderstandings, and ensures clarity in task expectations.

**Notifications**:

- When a task is updated, the system automatically sends notifications to the relevant workers and managers. This helps make sure that both parties remain up to date about their tasks.

**Payment**:

- After a trial period, users have to make a one-time payment. This helps the user get a feel for the system and check if they like it or not.
